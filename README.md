# Privacy Coin

As mentioned in the name, privacy is the main priority. We at privacy coin (PRC) uses a system that uses a user key that changes every time something is changed on the account; If the balance of the wallet is changed or if the password is changed or any other data that has to do with the account. The user key has to be stored in a safe place, and it is the users responsibility to keep the user key safe. And as we mentioned earlier the user key changes so an out-dated/invalid user key will be useless. You will also be given a private key that you would need to keep safe (the private key doesn't change). All of the transactions can not be monitored. This chain also uses its own custom encoding. Which prevents information leaks

# Exchange

You can exchange your PRC to a local or online PRC exchange, to exchange your PRC you would need to provide a valid user key (the one that changes if any account details or address is changed) and your private key.
