# The Cabbage Network

The so called "cabbage" is a puzzle that has many layers to it and the person who solves this puzzle first will get a cabbage coin reward, how hard of the puzzle will depend on how many layers there is (aka difficulty). The puzzle solving is called "peeling" and it is an algorithm made for weak computers (but you can peel on good computers by increasing the layers).

The cabbage network is open source so feel free to make chages and snoop through the code :)
