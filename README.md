# Privacy Coin

As said in the name, privacy is the main priority. We at privacy coin (PRC) use a secure sha256 encoding algorithm which when encoded, afterwards can no be decoded. All of the transactions can not be monitored. This chain also uses its own custom encoding. Which prevents information leaks, even if the person that wants the data whill not be able to see any information.

The chain has a simple and lightweight core which allows everything that is done on the chain, be extremely fast.

This project is only in BETA version, if you have any suggestions, you are free to make a pull request or just leave a comment, and don't be afraid to snoop around the code :)
